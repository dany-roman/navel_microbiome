## Objective

Create an interactive dashboard that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.



## Approach

Created a bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found within a specific patient sample.

Created a bubble chart to display the biodiversity of each sample.

Created a gauge to display the patient's handwashing frequency.

Created a list of the patient's demographic information
